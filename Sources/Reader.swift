 * error is encountered), the callback is called.   It can be assumed that the Reader will
 * most likely modify the buffer that was provided to call so the client must ensure that
 * either reads are queued by issue reads successively within each callback or by using
 * a queuing reader (such as the Pipe or BufferedReader) or by providing a different
